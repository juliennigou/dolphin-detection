This project focuses on protecting and studying dolphins through computer vision.

The main idea is simple: start from field images, detect dolphin fins, and then move toward identifying individual dolphins over time. This helps transform large photo collections into useful data for monitoring, research, and conservation work.

## Project Context

Many dolphin observation campaigns generate thousands of images. Reviewing them manually is long and repetitive. This project aims to support that work by creating a visual pipeline that can pre-screen images and highlight dolphin fins before human validation.

The workflow is designed to keep humans in the loop, so model predictions can be reviewed and improved over time.

## Project Goals

1. Detect dolphin fins in images (completed).
2. Identify individual dolphins from detections (in progress).

## Current Status

The detection stage has already produced strong results and is used as the foundation for the next phase.

The identification stage is now the active focus of the project.
